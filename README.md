# Android-Dev-Track
This is a repository, to keep organized both notes and exercises during 
the **Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Dev 2017 - 2018**, on *Udacity*.

There is going be a folder with my **notes on each lesson**. Those notes, are created in order to avoid searching back to which video there is the info I need, in case I get stuck while trying to create something new. Of course this also may become a beautiful source for any other fellow student who also needs a reminder, or even wants to understand a part that is confusing to him. I tried to explain the concepts that I thought needed to be explained, to keep them as a reference in the future. Also tried to include kind of template code, in order to find quickly how a certain thing is implemented in case I face any issue in future's apps.

Also there is going to be a folder with the excersices. And this folder will contain 2 subfolders. The **ToyApps**, and the **SunsineApp** folders. During the course, we have to do excersices related to each lesson. First we implement the new concepts to a ToyApp, and then at the end of each lesson we implement the group of the new consepts into the Sunsine app. There are ToDos in each project. In some of them *I will come back after finishing the course, to extend the ideas and add maybe a personal touch on them.*

## The Scholarship

The Scholarship is divides into two phases.

During the *first phase*, we are under a 3 months chalenge. We have to go though a predefined part of the course, and be active members of the community, meaning helping others when phasing a problem, also share good resources etc. 

At the end of the 1st phase, there will be a time out, until the officials, decide who passes to the next phase.

The *second phase* is a full scholarship for the **Udacity's Android Development Nanodegree**. 

So wish me luck!! An Good Luck to any other fellow student who might read this! 

*PS. If you are interested into Android Dev, I truly suggest you to keep an eye for the next scholarship and don't loose your chance to apply!*
